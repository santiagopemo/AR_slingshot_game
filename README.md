Once the application starts, the first thing you should do is look for a plane, just point the camera of your device towards a horizontal surface

Grab and drop the pokeballs towards the Pikachus to catch them. At the top of the screen you will see the number of remaining pokeballs and at the top your current score and two buttons, one to **Exit** the application and another to **Restart** it.
